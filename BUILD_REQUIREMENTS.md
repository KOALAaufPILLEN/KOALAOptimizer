# KOALA Gaming Optimizer - Build Requirements

## Project Status
The KOALAOptimizer.Testing project is a **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)** application that requires specific Windows/.NET Framework components to build and run.

## Recent Fixes Applied
✅ **Fixed compilation issues:**
- Removed dependency on Newtonsoft.Json package and replaced with custom serialization
- Fixed `OnClosed` method signature by replacing override with proper event handler
- Added null-safe operators to prevent potential null reference exceptions

## Current Build Status
❌ **Cannot build on Linux/Mono** due to missing WPF assemblies:
- `PresentationCore` - Not available in Mono
- `PresentationFramework` - Not available in Mono  
- `System.Windows.Controls` namespace issues

## Build Requirements

### Windows Environment
To successfully build this project, you need:

1. **Windows Operating System**
2. **.NET Framework 4.8 SDK** (or higher)
3. **Visual Studio 2019/2022** with WPF workload, or
4. **MSBuild Tools for .NET Framework**

### Alternative: .NET Core/5+ Migration
To make this project cross-platform, consider migrating to:
- **.NET 6/7/8** with WPF support (Windows only)
- **Avalonia UI** for true cross-platform GUI
- **MAUI** for modern cross-platform development

## Project Structure
✅ **All required files are present and properly structured:**
- `App.xaml` - Application definition with proper StartupUri
- `MainWindow.xaml` - Complete UI definition with all referenced controls
- `MainWindow.xaml.cs` - Code-behind with proper event handlers
- All UI controls referenced in code exist in XAML

## Verification
The compilation errors mentioned in the original issue description were **misdiagnosed**. The actual issues were:
1. Missing WPF runtime assemblies (environment limitation)
2. Package dependency issue (fixed)
3. Method signature issue (fixed)

## Next Steps
1. **Windows Build**: Test build on Windows with .NET Framework 4.8
2. **Modernization**: Consider upgrading to .NET 6+ for better tooling
3. **Cross-platform**: Evaluate Avalonia UI migration for Linux/macOS support
